# HateSpeech-Detection-using-Multi-Model-Approach
This repository contains the implementation of a Hate Speech Detection system using a multimodal approach across five datasets (English, Hindi, Urdu, and Hinglish). Multiple deep learning architectures were explored, with the LSTM-CNN hybrid model delivering the best performance for accurate and robust hate speech classification.
